- Be respectful of others. Harassment, discrimination, and other forms of disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
- Be honest and transparent. Do not misrepresent yourself or your contributions.
- Be responsible. If you make a mistake, own up to it and work to correct it.
- Be open-minded. We welcome contributions from all backgrounds and levels of experience.
- Be supportive. Help others to learn and grow as developers.
- Be constructive. Provide feedback that is helpful and actionable.
- Be professional. Keep in mind that this is a community of developers, not a platform for personal attacks or self-promotion.
